                                        My name is Hung (aka Vince). I was born in China, moved to Vietnam, and ended up in Houston, Texas where
                                        I won 4 Tae Kwon Do tournaments during my teenage years.<br />
                                        I am a programmer on the weekday, tennis player on the weekend, and gamer at night.<br /><br />

                                        My Favorite Quote by Albert Einstein: <br/> <br />

                                        <em>"Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid."</em>
